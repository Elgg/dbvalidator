Elgg Database Cleaner

It has a validate and a clean mode. It can fix the following problems:

1. user without a username
2. entity with owner_guid set to 0 (object or group)
3. entity with a deleted owner
4. entity that is missing an entry in its <type> table

Currently, it assumes its directory is set to dbvalidate.
